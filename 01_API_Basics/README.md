# **📖 API Basics - Structured Learning Plan**  

This section is designed to help you **understand and work with APIs** from scratch. You will learn:  
1. What APIs are and how they work  
2. Different types of APIs and when to use them  
3. HTTP fundamentals for API communication  
4. How to send API requests and handle responses  
5. Tools to test and debug APIs  

---

## **📌 Learning Plan**  

### **1️⃣ What is an API? → [Read More](#link-to-what-is-api)**  
📍 **Goal:** Understand what APIs are and why they are important.  
- Definition of an API  
- Real-world examples (Google Maps, Payment Gateways, Weather APIs)  
- How APIs enable communication between applications  

💡 **Task:**  
- Read about APIs and list 5 APIs you use daily.  

---

### **2️⃣ Types of APIs → [Read More](#link-to-types-of-api)**  
📍 **Goal:** Learn about different API architectures.  
- **REST APIs** (Representational State Transfer)  
- **SOAP APIs** (Simple Object Access Protocol)  
- **GraphQL** (Flexible querying language for APIs)  
- **WebSockets** (Real-time APIs)  
- **gRPC** (High-performance APIs)  

💡 **Task:**  
- Compare REST, GraphQL, and WebSockets and note key differences.  

---

### **3️⃣ HTTP Basics → [Read More](#link-to-http-basics)**  
📍 **Goal:** Learn how APIs use HTTP to communicate.  
- HTTP Methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.  
- Status Codes: `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`  
- HTTP Headers and Query Parameters  

💡 **Task:**  
- Explore HTTP requests using your browser’s DevTools.  

---

### **4️⃣ API Request & Response Structure → [Read More](#link-to-request-response)**  
📍 **Goal:** Understand the format of API requests and responses.  
- Anatomy of an API request  
- API response structure (Headers, Body, Status Code)  
- JSON vs XML  

💡 **Task:**  
- Manually create an API request in Postman and analyze the response.  

---

### **5️⃣ API Testing Tools**  

#### **🛠️ Postman → [Read More](#link-to-postman)**  
- Setting up Postman  
- Sending GET & POST requests  
- Handling authentication  

#### **🛠️ cURL → [Read More](#link-to-curl)**  
- Running API requests from the terminal  
- Sending headers and payloads  

#### **🛠️ Browser DevTools → [Read More](#link-to-browser-devtools)**  
- Inspecting network requests  
- Debugging API responses  

💡 **Task:**  
- Perform an API request using all three tools.

## **🎯 Outcomes**  

By completing this section, you will:  
1. Clearly understand **what APIs are and how they work**  
2. Know the **different types of APIs** and when to use them  
3. Be comfortable with **HTTP methods, status codes, and headers**  
4. Understand the **structure of API requests and responses**  
5. Be able to **test APIs using Postman, cURL, and DevTools**  

🚀 Once you're confident in these basics, move on to **Deep Dive into HTTP & REST** to learn more about best practices and advanced concepts!
